                <article>Clear a surface in your kitchen for you to set your stuff on. 
                    You're going to need some eggs (one to three depending on how many eggs you want), salt, pepper, and oil. 
                    <br><br>For oil, you can use liquid or spray-on, it's whatever you have available. For this demonstration, 
                    we'll be using spray on olive oil. You'll also be needing a frying pan to cook your egg on.

                <article>Just like the title says, place your frying pan on the stove top and heat it with low to mid heat. 
                    Spray oil on to the surface of the pan (if you are using liquid oil, go ahead pour a thin layer of oil onto the surface
                    of the pan and swish it around until it is spread evenly).</article>
